/**
 * This package contains the instrumentation model, called instrumentation
 * description. An instrumentation description conceptually describes how probes
 * (represented by
 * {@link edu.kit.ipd.sdq.eventsim.instrumentation.description.core.ProbeRepresentative
 * ProbeRepresentative}) and calculators (represented by
 * {@link edu.kit.ipd.sdq.eventsim.instrumentation.description.core.CalculatorRepresentative
 * CalculatorRepresentative}) should be added to entities (represented by
 * {@link edu.kit.ipd.sdq.eventsim.instrumentation.description.core.Instrumentable
 * Instrumentable}) in order to produce measurement data. Since this is only a
 * description, the actual implementation of the probes and calculators is
 * included.
